List of requirement changes required with the state of the code as in the com.zak.srp.example.bad package
=========================================================================================================

RC1. Presentation UI needs to display the total working hour only upto two decimal places :
	
	Solution in the current design:
	------------------------------------
	change the getTotalWorkingHour() to return the working hours upto two decimal places
	
	Problem with  the above solution
	------------------------------------
	This will break the salary business service as it will calculate incorrect payment due to lack of third decimal place value

RC2.New business rule to decrease the hourly pay of each employee whose total working hour is less than given amount of working hour
	
	Solution with the current design:
	------------------------------------
	create a new method in the Employee class to return all the employees whose total working hour is less than or equal to given value
