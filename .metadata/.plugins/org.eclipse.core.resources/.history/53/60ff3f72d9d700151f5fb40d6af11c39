Open Closed Principle(OCP) states that a class, module or any software entity should be "Open for extension" and "Closed for modification"

What does "Open for Extension" means???

	Open for extension means that one should be able to add new features or requirements to an existing class , module or software entity.
	
What does "Closed for Modification" means??

	Closed for modification means that one should not be able to change the existing code in a software entity, class or module .
	
Now according based on the above two definition we can describe OCP as below.

	OCP says that we should be able to add new features or requirements to our existing class module or software entity without 
	changing the existing code for that class module or software entity .
	
	The above idea seems a bit far fetched .. but believe me it is possible to achieve in many cases if not all.

If your module or class conforms to OCP principle . You should be able to add new features without changing lots of code in lots of different places.


Now lets go through all the classes in out com.zak.ocp.example.bad package one by one and try to see wether they conform to OCP or not

1. Employee : 
-------------	
	This class holds data about an employee . So we need to change it if some new data is required for employees.
	Nothing much we can do on that as for each new data we would have no choice but to create a new member in the Employee class.

2. ReportBusinessServie :  
-------------------------
	
	Lets assume a requirement change client now wants to have one more format of report along with the other three we already have.
	Now to incorporate this new report format. We will have to add one new method in the  EmployeeReportGenerator to create a report for employee in the new format
