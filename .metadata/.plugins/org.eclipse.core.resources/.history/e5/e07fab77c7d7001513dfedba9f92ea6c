List of requirement changes required with the state of the code as in the com.zak.srp.example.bad package
=========================================================================================================

RC1. Presentation UI needs to display the total working hour only upto two decimal places :
	Solution with the current situation:
	change the getTotalWorkingHour() to return the working hours upto two decimal places
	This will break the salary business service as it will calculate incorrect payment due to lack of third decimal place value

RC2.New business rule to decrease the hourly pay of each employee whose total working hour is less than given amount of working hour
