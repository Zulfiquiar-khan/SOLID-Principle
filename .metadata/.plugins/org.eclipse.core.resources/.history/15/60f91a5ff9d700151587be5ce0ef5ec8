Liskov's Substitution Principle
===============================

Given by Barbara Liskov in the year of 1987 (Java was created in the year of 1995)

============

 If S is a subtype of T in a program then all objects of type T in the program can be substituted to objects of type S 
 without changing any desired properties of the program(eg correctness).
 
 Supertypes are substitutable by their subtype.
 
 
 "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program" 
 
 "it means that we must make sure that new derived classes are extending the base classes without changing their behavior"
 
 
 Behavioral subtyping is a stronger notion than typical subtyping of functions defined in type theory, 
 which relies only on the contravariance of argument types and covariance of the return type
 
 Behavioral subtyping is trivially undecidable in general: if q is the property "method for x always terminates",
 then it is impossible for a program (e.g., a compiler) to verify that it holds true for some subtype S of T, even if q does hold for T.
 Nonetheless, the principle is useful in reasoning about the design of class hierarchies.
 
 Liskov's principle imposes some standard requirements on signatures which have been adopted in newer object-oriented programming languages 
 (usually at the level of classes rather than types):

    Contravariance of method arguments in the subtype.
    Covariance of return types in the subtype.
    No new exceptions should be thrown by methods of the subtype, except where those exceptions are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.

In addition to the signature requirements, the subtype must meet a number of behavioral conditions. 
These are detailed in a terminology resembling that of design by contract methodology, 
leading to some restrictions on how contracts can interact with inheritance:

    Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
    Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype.
    Invariants of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
    History constraint (the "history rule"). 
    Objects are regarded as being modifiable only through their methods (encapsulation). 
    Since subtypes may introduce methods that are not present in the supertype, 
    the introduction of these methods may allow state changes in the subtype that are not permissible in the supertype. 
    The history constraint prohibits this. It was the novel element introduced by Liskov and Wing. 
    A violation of this constraint can be exemplified by defining a mutable point as a subtype of an immutable point.
     This is a violation of the history constraint, because in the history of the immutable point, 
     the state is always the same after creation, so it cannot include the history of a mutable point in general. 
     Fields added to the subtype may however be safely modified because they are not observable through the supertype methods. 
     Thus, one can derive a circle with fixed center but mutable radius from immutable point without violating LSP.
